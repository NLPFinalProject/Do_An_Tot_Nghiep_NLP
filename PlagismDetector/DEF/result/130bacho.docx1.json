        "Blockchain offers an  unparalleled level of decentralisation and  transparency,  with  a  tradeoff  in  performance  and  interconnectivity.",
        "For most single chains, the top priority is scalability, or to increase their processing speed, with transactions per  second  (TPS)  as  the  key  metric.",
        "A  popular  technique being  used  is  sharding  [1],  which  is  the  division  of  the blockchain into smaller shards (sub-chains) and simultaneous processing of the transactions, promising TPS from thousands to millions.",
        "However, even based on theoretical estimations of existing projects, no single chain appears to be able to handle the calculating power needed for mass adoption.",
        "For instance, Facebook facilitate  major interactions: as every 60 seconds there are 510,000 comments, 293,000  statuses,  and  136,000  photos  uploaded  [2].",
        "On Instagram, 4 billion likes per day would result in over 46k tps [3].",
        "In Youtube\u2019s case, 1 billion hours of  video  watched per day means nearly 7 million tps, assuming one piece of content is requested every 6 seconds per user session [4].",
        "requires  over  16k",
        "A prominent reason for this obsession over TPS is that single chains  often  suffer  from  lack  of  interoperability,  meaning  they cannot  communicate  with  each  other,  and  therefore,  operations cannot  be  done  on  multi-chain.",
        "The  lack  of  interoperability significantly  reduces the  chance  of  a  finding  appropriate blockchain-based  solutions  for  many  real-time  problems  in various  businesses.",
        "For  example,  while  there  are  many  chains supporting  smart  contracts,  each  platform  has  a  different computational  capability.",
        "In  an  extreme  case,  Bitcoin-based blockchains do not even support smart contracts [5].",
        "This means that there is virtually no way to build a complete solution using just  one  chain.",
        "As  there  is    no  one-size-fits-all  solution  for  a blockchain application, this creates a steep learning curve if one desires to build smart contracts on different chains.",
        "B.  Inter-chain Blockchains",
        "1)  The  scaling  cube:  If  one  thinks  of  a  single  chain  as  a single  computer  or  a  local  network,  it  would  be  much  more scalable  to  connect  more  computers  to  share  the  workload, instead of building an increasingly faster supercomputer.",
        "The following section employs a widely used visualization known as the scaling cube [7] to better map different approaches in blockchain scalability:",
        "\u2022  X-axis  =  Horizontal  duplication  =  Transaction  routing: data  is  stored  on  multiple  nodes  to  reduce  traffic  and avoid congestion.",

        "Many  single-chain  solutions  focus  on  Z  scaling  by  implementing  sharding.",
        "For  example,  Ethereum  network  sets sharding as one of the main focus of the next version [11].",
        "The KardiaChain team aims to achieve full 3-dimensional scaling by putting emphasis on X/Y scaling while leveraging the sharding of existing and upcoming blockchains.",
        "Because of interoperability, similar  tasks  can  be  shared  between  blockchain  platforms  to achieve  X  scaling.",
        "For  Y  scaling,  an  on-chain  operation  can be divided into smaller tasks and run on different blockchains.",

        "2)  Related works: While many  attempts have been implemented to develop interoperability between blockchains, each of the participating chains, which may have required major updates, even forks (soft and hard).",
        "An attempt in making changes to a specific blockchain will lead to two significant side effects: 1) a  hard  fork  may  be  required  to  accommodate  the  new changes; 2) security issues may arise when one tries to change the core configurations of the blockchain as mentioned above.",
        "This section discusses some common cross-chain approaches.",
        "a)  Sidechains:  Sidechain  is  a  blockchain  that  runs parallel  to  the  main  blockchain,  which  extends  functionality through interoperable blockchain networks, allowing a decentralised  way  of tokens between  the  two  chains  [12].",
        "In  other  words,  one  can  move one\u2019s  cryptocurrency  to  the  sidechain  and  then  back  to  the main  chain.",
        "The  problem  with  sidechains  is  that  assets transferred to sidechains (and back to mainchain) need to be locked  for  a  certain  duration,  called  the  contestant  period, before  they  become  transferrable.",
        "Although  the  idea  of sidechain  dates  back  to  2014,  so  far  there  has  been  no provable is  mature  enough  and production ready.",

        "Treating  everything  as  messages  creates  a need  for  an  extra  layer  to  filter  and  order  them  messages.",
        "Simply speaking, the network need to sanitise the messages implementation that before putting them on the ledger.",
        "This process may actually require extra effort, which would lead to performance issues.",
        "In  the  opinion  of  the  KardiaChain  team,  KardiaChain  can extract  the  essential  data  from  external  transactions  directly, thanks  to  the  immutability  of  the  blockchain,  and  thus  KardiaChain can omit this extra, perhaps unnecessary, layer.",
        "c)  Hub/Connector/Adaptor:  Hub  (connector/adaptor)  is designed  to  be  the  communication  channel  between  participating blockchains.",
        "Through this kind of channel, blockchains can interact  with each other to transact and exchange assets.",
        "One of the most famous implementations of this approach is Polkadot  [14].",
        "The  critical  problem  of  this  approach  is  that participating  chains  must  be  compatible  with  the  hub    for cross  chain  communication,  which  means the  current blockchains need to be changed (forked) to join the networks.",
        "In other words, the hub approach does not adapt to others but instead  requires  the  participating  chains  to  change.",
        "This  is believed  to  be  counter  intuitive  to  the  meaning  of  both interoperability and practicability.",
        "3)  KardiaChain  approach  -  Integration  Without  Assimilation:  In  simple  terms,  KardiaChain  adapts  to  others.",

        "ABSTRACT Creating  an  accurate,  up  to  date  and  relevant  depiction  of  the  European  research  infrastructure landscape through the cataloguing of research infrastructures and the dissemination of the collected information  is  the  main  goal  of  the  MERIL-2  project.",
        "Moving  towards  this  goal  is  mostly  served  by providing online services to related stakeholders and to end users that need to be informed accordingly.",
        "Facilitating the needs of these user groups is a crucial aspect for the success of the MERIL-2 project.",
        "In order to identify the user activities and to translate them into system functionality, the MERIL-2 team has collected and documented a broad set of user stories, i.e.",
        "simple descriptions of user needs related to functions and to information.",
        "The current deliverable contains a comprehensive list of user stories accompanied by relevant information and structured according to specific rules dictated by software engineering principles.",
        "This collection is used as the basis for designing the MERIL-2 web platform and as a means to check if the system in hand conforms to the documented specifications.",
        "In terms of system implementation, the information provided in the current deliverable constitutes the initial phase of the software\u2019s life cycle.",
        "28 June 2016",
        "Introduction: Identifying User Needs  The MERIL-2 web portal will be comprised by two distinct functional parts, the Portal itself (front end) and the Back Office (back end).",
        "These two facets of the MERIL-2 web platform will provide the processing components and information outlets to the broad community of users that the system will serve.",
        "The scope of the project dictates the diversity of users\u2019 groups and their role in the workflows that the system implements and the services it provides.",
        "These user groups have been already reported and their roles analyzed  in  the  MERIL-2  deliverable  D1.21.",
        "Following  the  description  of  the  user  groups,  the identification and the cataloguing of the user needs is the next crucial step for document the functional aspects of the MERIL-2 web platform.",
        "For this purpose the MERIL-2 team has chosen to describe the functionality at the business level with the usage of a collection of User Stories.",
        "A User Story is a short informal description of a very specific user need in business terms, using nontechnical  language.",
        "Each  User  Story  is  produced  by  analyzing  the  business  goals  of  the  project  in conjunction with the various characteristics of the user groups and the restrictions and requirements that  the  project\u2019s  business  context  poses.",
        "In  this  deliverable  the  MERIL-2  team  has  collected  and organized accordingly a number of User Stories as an initial step for the full description of the MERIL-2 web platform.",
        "Based on the Agile software development paradigm the User Stories are used to form a structured depiction of MERIL-2 web platform and to produce a basis that the implementation iterations will rely on and the implementation results will be checked against.",
        "The deliverable is structured as follows.",
        "First we introduce the formal terms and the structure of the core  analysis  based  on  the  Agile  software  development  paradigm.",
        "The  next  chapter  describes  the methodology and the information sources used.",
        "The main body of the document  is dealing with the presentation of the user stories and their usage in order to produce a description framework for the MERIL-2 web platform.",
        "The deliverable concludes with the conclusions that were drawn by the process of documenting the user stories.",
        "Background The Agile software development paradigm is a set of non-strict principles for software development that emphasize on and promote collaboration between the various teams that are involved throughout the development of a piece of software.",
        "These principles are described in the so called Agile Manifesto2 and highlight the importance of:",
        "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools",
        "\uf0b7  Working software over comprehensive documentation",
        "\uf0b7  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation",
        "\uf0b7  Responding to change over following a plan",
        "Describing  and  document  the  functional  requirements  and  drawing  important  insight  from  this collection remains an important activity in the Agile paradigm.",
        "One of the tools used for doing so is the identification of the User Stories.",
        "A user story is a short informal description of a very specific user need in business terms, using non-technical language.",
        "Each user story is produced by analyzing the business goals of the project in conjunction with the various characteristics of the user groups and the restrictions and requirements that the project\u2019s business context poses.",
        "User stories promote the communication between  the  business  stakeholders  and  the  development  team  early  in  the  project\u2019s  life  cycle  and emphasize on attaining a clear but not necessarily complete understanding of the goals and features as",
        "1 D1.2 Management Agreement (29-04-2016) 2 https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/",
        "28 June 2016",
        "soon as possible.",
        "The evolution of user stories is initiated through the Description of the various user stories,  matures  through  the  motivation  of  Conversation  between  the  project\u2019s  stakeholders  and  it concludes with the Confirmation that the objectives agreed through conversation have been achieved.",
        "In order to confirm if what a user story describes has become a part of the software, all user stories are accompanied  by  a  set  of  Acceptance  Criteria.",
        "An  acceptance  criterion  is  a  feature  the  system  must provide that satisfies the need expressed in the user story.",
        "Similarly, an acceptance criterion doesn\u2019t have to be expressed with technical terms.",
        "Each user story can have a number of acceptance criteria but not  too  many  because  this  is an  indicator  that  the user  story  is  broader  than  it should  and  must  be broken  down  to  smaller  distinct  user  stories.",
        "Acceptance  criteria  should  be  compiled  taken  into consideration quality attributes, system efficiency and constraints, e.g. if the criterion is the prefilling of a web form then the form should be prefilled by the system in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "Also, each user story should be accompanied by an importance indicator and flagged as critical or not.",
        "The importance indicator can be whatever is dimmed appropriate e.g. a numerical value between 1 and 5  or  a  simple  label  like  \u201cvery  important\u201d.",
        "This  information  is  used  by  the  implementation  teams  to prioritize the implementation tasks.",
        "User stories can be grouped under a broader scope which is called an Epic.",
        "An Epic is a User Activity or Task  which  needs  to  be  accomplished  to  do  the  work  of  the  product,  the  large  discrete  sets  of functionality which need to be delivered so as to be able to say we have solved the problem in hand.",
        "Examples of epics are Authenticate user, Create an RI entry, etc.",
        "Epics can be determined prior to the collection of the user stories by identifying high level business goals and/or after by organizing (cluster) the before unorganized user stories.",
        "All user stories can be organized under each epic ranked by their importance indicator.",
        "Each epic with its user stories can be laid out in a single row showing the logical sequence and handoffs between the steps in the process or the order in which someone would describe activities to explain the behaviour of  the  system.",
        "This  structure  forms  the  Story  Map,  a  2D  structure  that  horizontally  describes  the sequence of actions and vertically the importance of user stories.",
        "The sequence of epics does not have to  be  strict;  epics  that  run  in  parallel  can  be  put  next  to  each  other.",
        "The  story  map  can  be  used  to determine the set of user stories that if satisfied according to their acceptance criteria can form a fully functional system, but not a final one.",
        "This set is called the Minimum Viable Product.",
        "Based  on  the  aforementioned  terms  and  tools,  this  deliverable  documents  various  user  stories, organizes them accordingly and provides a story map.",
        "This is done by first identifying the user groups of MERIL-2 web platform.",
        "Methodology Usually  the  documentation  of  user  stories  is  a  process  that  is  initiated  through  consultations  with stakeholders and a dialogue with the implementing team.",
        "In the case of MERIL-2 there are also other sources  of  information  such  as  the  MERIL  advisory  committee  and  experiences  gathered  during  the previous phases of MERIL.",
        "We have divided these to four categories, existing documentation, hands-on experience, meetings and online questionnaires.",
        "As  MERIL-2  is  the  evolution  of  the  previous MERIL  project,  some of the  documents that  describe  its functionality  were  available.",
        "The  document  that  was  used  from  MERIL  is  the  Book  of  Specifications (BoS)3 created by Avendas AG (currently Thomson Reuters) which was the company that was assigned",
        "3 Book-of-Specification for MERIL (BoS) (05-112-2011)",
        "28 June 2016",
        "the contract for the implementation of the MERIL portal and back office.",
        "The document has been revised critically so as to identify the functionalities that are also going to be implemented in the MERIL-2 web platform.",
        "A second document was the MERIL-2 deliverable D1.24.",
        "In this deliverable ESF has documented, among others, the basic workflows for submitting information to the MERIL-2 web platform.",
        "These workflows describe the processes from the different perspectives of the various user groups that are responsible for providing, checking and publishing content.",
        "The same workflows were used for the identification of the main user groups.",
        "As  part  of  the  preparation  for  the  documentation  of  MERIL-2\u2019s  data  model,  ESF  created  an  early description of the data model by cataloguing the data fields that the current estimation regarding data concluded  that  are  needed.",
        "This  document  was  also  used  to  collect  information  for  user  stories.",
        "Although the data model is not by itself a prime source of user stories since it focuses on the specification of data and not on user activities, one can derive information that can be used for envisioning possible functionalities.",
        "This is especially true for data fields that are new compared to the previous MERIL web platform.",
        "Since the previous MERIL web platform is still an on-line production system, EKT was granted system configuration access.",
        "The team of developers of EKT has reviewed the various facets of the system by actually using and browsing the available tools and web pages.",
        "MERIL-2 will also share some features that the MERIL web platform already provides so by actually using these features one can draw useful conclusions regarding user needs.",
        "Another source of information was the various meetings between the project\u2019s stakeholders.",
        "The most influential and the one that was actually organized for the purpose of collecting information and gain a better understanding regarding the current needs of the main user groups, was the MERIL National Data intermediaries Workshop that was held in Paris on May 11th and 12th.",
        "Through the various sessions and the diverse conversations that took place, the MERIL team documented a plethora of information some of which were used to produce user stories.",
        "Three group sessions were held, one related to MERIL\u2019s data  needs  in  terms  of what  data  are  expected  to  be  available  for  the  end  user,  one  related  to  the eligibility criteria for new RIs and the quality of information and one related to the functionalities of the new  web  portal.",
        "All  three  groups  contributed  on  drawing  solid  conclusions  regarding  the  business features of the provided services.",
        "The NDI Meeting concluded with the MERIL Partner Meeting (on May 12th) where all MERIL partners participated.",
        "The discussion provided insight regarding some new features of MERIL-2 web platform and various ideas were suggested.",
        "Adopting a more pragmatic approach, the features that were discussed were  analyzed  in  more  detail  taking  into  consideration  feasibility  in  terms  of  data  collection,  time constraints and implementation difficulties.",
        "An  online  questionnaire  was  also  deployed5  with  the  purpose  of  collecting  information  on  specific questions mostly targeted to NDIs so as to let NDIs express their own needs and expectations regarding the new web platform.",
        "In Appendix A the reader can review the questions in the questionnaire.",
        "This survey is available until July 15th.",
        "All previous information sources were used to compile an unstructured set of user stories.",
        "To better organize them and according to the Agile paradigm, the user groups were identified, the various epics",
